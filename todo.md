# FE
* Open a Map with all locations and their names on top.
	when the user clicks on location close the map and select the location.
* When in dashboard/calendar we should show the trip details if any since we have a picked
    date already.
* When loading a trip, start loading the weather data and show a skeleton in each card instead of flashing styles or loading text.
* Make the data in trip details scrollable since later on we will have marine data as well.
* Make the weather data responsive they are overflowing the card.
* When showing the weather specific hours should be shown first.

# BE
* Use the marine forecast API to get data regarding the weather for each trip.

* Check why the weather data response takes a long time.
* Trip should have a time that took place.
