	Need to be careful since PageLayout used to contain BaseLayout if then would we try
	to use <Content /> (which we should) to render the post everything will be
	rendered inside there meaning the <meta> tags will be in there
	instead of the <head> causing all sort of issues like not rendering UTF-8 chars.
